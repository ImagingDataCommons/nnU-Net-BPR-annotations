Then a pretrained model from nnUNet [1] (SegTHOR task055) is used to predict a set of four thoracic organs for each series in the collection (esophagus, trachea, aorta and heart). Segmentations are saved as DICOM SEG objects. The pyradiomics package is then used to compute the 3D shape features for each segmented organ, and are saved as DICOm Structured Reports. The Body Part Regression method [2] is used to define organ and bone landmarks and regions (head, shoulder-neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and legs) for each axial slice of the CT scan. These results are saved into DICOM Structured Reports. Lastly, all SEG and SR files are saved to a bucket, uploaded to a DICOM datastore and timing results saved into a table. \n",
